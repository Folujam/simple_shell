Getline function Pseudocode


ssize_t getline(char **restrict lineptr, size_t *restrict n,
                       FILE *restrict stream);

Restrict is there to tell the compiler that no other pointer will acess the lineptr

lineptr this is a pointer to the buffer where the line is stored it is allocated dynamically 

n: This is a pointer to the size of the buffer

Stream: The input stream 

Getline returns the number of characters read including the newline function and -1
If memory is not enough it reallocates memory

Process

First i need the value of n to allocate memory
Before that i will allocate memory with what has already been passed
Then i will get the input and use a while loop to get n
I would use getchar function to read from stdin
{ss
To use getc  function i need to store each character
while reading it and at the same time i need to get n
}
To fix that issue i will declare another variable and copare the size to n if it is lower than n increase n and reallocate continue using a while loop
also check for failure of thr allocation
After reallocating assign what was read to the lineptr
Then use n to allocate memory to line ptr
